# Show-Searcher

Show Searcher is a project created for practicing and improving my skills.

Show Searcher app is an application that uses the public api http://www.tvmaze.com/api to fetch and display shows, with this application you can search different tv shows as well as add them to your favorites shows, you can then go to the detail of the show and see information about that specific show, you can also see a list of the episodes diveded by seasons and see a detail of that episode.


This project uses:

* Auto Layout
